# Scientific Methodology Notes

## Key Concepts

### Step 1: Study
- **What to Study?**
  - Scholarly Articles
  - Academic Books
- **Credibility Check:** Is your source reliable? This is generally referred to as a literature survey.

### Step 2: Hypothesis
- **Definition:**
  - Specific and focused
  - Testable and falsifiable
- **Difference from Theory:** A hypothesis is not a theory.

### Step 3: Test Against Real-World Data
- **Experimentation:**
  - Validate hypotheses through experiments.
  - If experimental results disagree, the hypothesis is wrong.

### Key Understanding
- Science aims to determine what is more or less likely, not absolute impossibilities.
- Definite theories can always be proven wrong.

## Analysis of Experiments

### Observations and Errors
- Identify potential errors.
  - **Variance** and **Standard Deviation**
  - **Error Propagation**
- Make inferences and conclusions.

### Types of Errors
1. **Random Errors:**
   - Caused by chance fluctuations.
   - Minimized by averaging multiple measurements.
2. **Systematic Errors:**
   - Consistent biases in measurements.
   - Require careful analysis of experimental setups and instruments.

### Accuracy vs Precision
- **Accuracy:** How closely a measured value aligns with the actual value.
- **Precision:** Closeness of repeated measurements to each other (reproducibility).

## Error Propagation

### Calculations
- **Addition/Subtraction:**
  \[ \Delta z = \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2} \]
- **Multiplication/Division:**
  \[ \frac{\Delta z}{z} = \frac{\Delta x}{x} + \frac{\Delta y}{y} \]
- **For Functions:**
  \[ \Delta Z = f'(x) \cdot \Delta X \]

### Statistical Measures
- **Mean (\( \bar{x} \))**:
  \[ \bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n} \]
- **Variance (\( \sigma^2 \))**:
  Measurement of data spread relative to the mean.
- **Standard Deviation (\( \sigma \))**:
  Measures the dispersion of data points from the mean.
